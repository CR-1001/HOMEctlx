## Technical background
Most user interface interactions in HomeCtl are handled via a lean view-model 
framework: HTTP requests are handled by reqhandlers/commands.py. 
Received arguments are passed to the view-models using services/cmdexec.py.
The view-models return meta data describing the new state of the user 
interface. The corresponding HTML is rendered and send to the client.
JavaScript on the client side, static/cmdex.js, collects data from input 
fields, calls the server and updates the user interface.
