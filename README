# HomeCtl
HomeCtl is a lean and modular smart home system.

## Modules and Functions
- **Files**: Share and edit files.
- **Light**: Control your Philips Hue light system.
- **Ambients**: Define static and dynamic scenes with a scripting language.
- **Alarms**: Schedule alarms and timers.
- **Telemetry**: Maintenance functions.

## Installation and Configuration
- The accompanying installation manual describes the requirements and setup process.
- Configuration (regarding the `lightctl` executable, etc.) is set in `config.json`.
- The `share` directory contains the files to be shared (and the landing page `start.md`). 

## Technical Background
Most user interface interactions in HomeCtl are handled via a lean view-model framework. HTTP requests are managed by `services/reqhandler.py`. Received arguments are passed to the view-models in the `viewmodels` module. The view-models return metadata describing the new state of the user interface. The corresponding HTML is rendered and sent to the client. JavaScript on the client side, `cmdex.js`, collects data from input fields, calls the server, and updates the user interface.
